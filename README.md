# Slate
Slate is an application that smartly organizes your schedule, right from the input box.

Simply tell the time, day, and list out the tasks!!

## How it Works
If you want to finish your programming homework and read Zero to One today from 3pm - 5pm, you can pass this in the input:

```
From 3-5 today, finish your programming homework, read Zero to One
```

This will create a visual block from 3-5 on the screen:

```
Today from 3-5:
- Finish your programming homework
- Read Zero to One
```

## Installation
